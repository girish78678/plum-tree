                    <p>With its wood-panelled and mud-plastered walls, this is the closest you get to live in a typical 'Himachali' home in Shimla. We are only over two years old but have already garnered appreciation from travellers, media and award committees

                    <p>This award-winning farmstay sits bang in the middle of an organic Permaculture orchard. It is far from the madding crowd of Himachal’s hill towns (74kms from Shimla ). It is suitable for those looking for seclusion, tranquility, nature,
                        and the surreal experience of living in an apple orchard. There is one 4-bedrooms bungalow with the sunroom, an attic, lounging areas which can accommodate up to 15 people. The new two-bedroom Doghri is built for luxury and has
                        two independent rooms suitable for couples and small families.</p>
